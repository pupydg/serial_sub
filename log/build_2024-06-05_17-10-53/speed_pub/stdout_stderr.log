  By not providing "Findspeed_control.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "speed_control", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "speed_control"
  with any of the following names:

    speed_controlConfig.cmake
    speed_control-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "speed_control" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "speed_control_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "speed_control" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
